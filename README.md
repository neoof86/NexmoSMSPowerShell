# NexmoSMSPowerShell
A PowerShell app that allows your apps to send messages via Nexmo from AD users
You will need a version of RSAT (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=45520) on your machine you wish to send from to allow the group searches

To Do:-
1. Allow a file to be read in for local sending without AD
2. Clean up and place better warning/errors in the logging
3. See if I can make anything else a function
4. Probably see if I need to do anything else for more international numbers
